Call Transcript Analyzer using Groq API
This project is a simple Python server built with Flask that analyzes customer call transcripts. It uses the Groq API to perform fast AI-powered analysis, generating a concise summary and determining the customer's sentiment. The results are then saved to a CSV file for record-keeping. 



Features

API Endpoint: Accepts a call transcript via a POST request to the /analyze endpoint. 


AI-Powered Summary: Leverages the Groq API to generate a 2-3 sentence summary of the conversation. 


Sentiment Analysis: Extracts the customer's sentiment, classifying it as Positive, Neutral, or Negative. 



Data Storage: Saves the original transcript, summary, and sentiment into a call_analysis.csv file. 

Requirements
